ExerciciosBasicos
This project contains several Python scripts that perform various tasks.

Calc.py
This script provides a simple calculator functionality.
It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation,
and square root operations. The user is prompted to choose an operation,
and then to enter the numbers to be operated on.

Palindromo.py
This script checks if a given phrase is a palindrome. 
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, 
or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward,
ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

anagram.py
This script creates an anagram of a given name. 
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
typically using all the original letters exactly once.

areas.py
This script calculates the area of a circle, triangle, or square.
The user is prompted to choose a shape and then to enter the necessary dimensions (
    radius for a circle, base and height for a triangle, side for a square).

Each script is standalone and can be run independently.
They all use Python's built-in libraries, so no additional packages need to be installed.
